#Kaggle competiton

We competed in a university kaggle competition to detect fake job advertisements. We were a team of 5 people and split the data analysis evenly. We decided each person take a column to analyse according to data type. 

We proceeded to data wrangle and filter. You can see the resulting code in their respective folders.

I then proceeded to code and run multiple experiments in the current_experiment folder with various machine learning techniques through cross validation using various machine techniques.
